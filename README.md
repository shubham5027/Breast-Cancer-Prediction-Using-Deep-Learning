# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks
This project employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict breast cancer based on  numerical features. With an accuracy of 96 % without overfitting also it consist preporcessing pipelines using which easier traformation of data, deep learning artchtexture uses Hyperparameter Tuning using Keras Tuner which Enhance Performance.

# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Neural Networks

This repository contains code for a breast cancer prediction project using neural networks. The goal is to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer (Malignant or Benign) based on various features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- diagnosis
- radius_mean
- texture_mean
- perimeter_mean
- area_mean
- smoothness_mean
- compactness_mean
- concavity_mean
- concave points_mean
- ... (and more)

The dataset is available in the file `breast_cancer_data.csv`. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a breast cancer biopsy, and the "diagnosis" column indicates whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).
